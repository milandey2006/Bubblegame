In this projects we had made one bubble then using javascript I made that one bubble in multiples using for loop.

Then I used Math.floor(Math.random()*10) to display the random numbers in the bubbles and multiplyed by 10 so that the number should be less tha 10. 

I used SetTimeout for the timer to run from 60 sec to 0 sec. After the 60 seconds is completed the display will be showing "Game Over" using queryselector

Then I made a function for score where if the click is write where it is displayed then the score should increase by 10 
For ex:- score +=10. += because we dont want the score to be reset += will add up the previous score with 10.
